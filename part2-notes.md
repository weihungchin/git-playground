## Revert

## Undo changes
Undoing changes in own (feature branch), commits that are not yet merged to shared branch (typically master/main/develop).

### With hard reset
1. `git reset --hard HEAD~`
2. This will remove the last commit (together with all the changes). 
3. This command is destructive (all uncommitted local changes is gone).
